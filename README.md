# sample-api-proxying
This concise yet illustrative example uses NodeJS and the Express framework to create a Proxy API Server. It serves data from three APIs, including one that requires an API key to authenticate the user.

## Getting Started
1. Download the source code
2. Use npm to install the Express framework, and the request node modules
3. Use node to run the server
4. Access the APIs at `localhost:3000`

## Notes
The "ltamall" API will not work unless you enter your API key.
